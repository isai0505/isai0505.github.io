##My name is Isai and I am a tax lawyer here in Los Angeles, CA. In 2017 I had a great idea to create a bookkeeping software, think online bookkeeking software. For years as a tax lawyers I kept seeing small business make the same mistakes time and time again on their bookkeeping software and ultimately on their tax returns. So I decided to seek out some data scientists and software programers. I had no idea between HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Ruby, Rails ,etc. No clue. We created a product called ThynkBooks (www.thynkbooks.com) and the team I hired built it on React and Redux using AWS. I have learned a lot since then. 

My project is in live beta mode with actual paying users and trying to get some traction. However, as a hands on lawyer I like to know what I am working on and what I am doing. If my clients have any tax problems I can fix it or figure it out, but with software I am absolutely lost. So that is why I decided to sign up for Flatiron self-paced program. I may not be looking to be a programmer ultimately, but I want to know how my software works and how I can reach the most people to help. That is what I plan to do. 

I am about 2-3 weeks into Flatiron. I will admist its not what I thought it was going to be, but I appreciate their efforts to make sure that I figure things out. The ask a questiosn is very nice and I use it often. That is it for now.
