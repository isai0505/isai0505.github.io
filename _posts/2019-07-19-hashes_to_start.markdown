Learning about hashes has been an interesting experience. I think the short of it is that it gets a value that is mapped to a data set and then there is an output of that data set. I think the best way for me to look at it is like a function that searches for a matching, Bob = 7 somewhere there is data that when you see Bob it hashes 7 from a data table available. Its the best example I can come up with to explain it.
